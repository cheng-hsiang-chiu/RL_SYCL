## Task Graph Input


# Structure
- {20000,250,26,7}.in : input file of task graph of {20000,250,26,7} nodes
- _small_matrix.in    : input file of task graph of real circuit with small matrix size
- _big_matrix.in      : input file of task graph of real circuit with big matrix size


# Input file of small matrix size
For input file of small matrix size, the matrix size is picked between [5,6,7,8,9,10,20,30,40,50]
70% of the task has matrix size ranging between [5,6,7,8,9,10].
30% of the task has matrix size ranging between [20,30,40,50].


# Input file of big matrix size
For input file of big matrix size, the matrix size is picked between [4,8,16,32,64,128,255,512,1024,2048]
70% of the task has matrix size ranging between [4,8,16,32,64,128].
30% of the task has matrix size ranging between [256,512,1024,2048].
